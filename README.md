House prices depend on multiple factors such as size, location, and amenities. In this project, we use Supervised Learning (Regression) to train a model that predicts house prices from historical data.

This project demonstrates:

Data loading and exploration

Data cleaning and preprocessing

Feature selection

Model training using Linear Regression

Model evaluation using metrics like R² Score and Mean Squared Error

Making predictions on new data

⚙️ Tech Stack

Python 🐍

NumPy

Pandas

Matplotlib / Seaborn (for visualization)

Scikit-learn

🚀 How It Works

Data Collection
Dataset containing house features and prices is used.

Data Preprocessing

Handle missing values

Convert categorical data if needed

Feature scaling (optional)

Model Training

Split data into training and testing sets

Train using Linear Regression

Evaluation

Compare predicted vs actual prices

Check accuracy using evaluation metrics

Prediction

Input new house features

Model predicts the estimated price

📊 Example Use Cases

Real estate price estimation

Market trend analysis

Learning ML basics with a practical project

Academic mini-project

🎯 Future Improvements

Use advanced models (Random Forest, XGBoost)

Deploy as a web app

Add larger real-world datasets

Improve feature engineering
